# myPosts
![demo](../docs/demo.gif)
A Vue.js app that consumes posts from an API and then displays those posts, and lets the user filter the posts by finding even or odd IDs.

# Getting Started
To run this app, run npm start from the root directory, 
and then in a different terminal window, run npm run dev from 
the client directory. Once both the client side and the server 
side apps build, you can go to localhost:8080/#/posts to 
see the API call and filtering of the data based on even or odd ID.
